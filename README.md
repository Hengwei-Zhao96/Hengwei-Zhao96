# Hi!👋

✨I'm a Ph.D. candidate at LIESMARS, Wuhan University.  
✨I received B.S. degree from the School of Resources and Civil Engineering, Northeastern University in 2019.  
✨I'm now a member of RSIDEA group, advised by Prof. Yanfei Zhong.

✨My research interest is learning-based weakly supervised remote sensing image processing.  
😄I am a beginner in the satellite imagery data science competition.
