### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing (LIESMARS), Wuhan University.  
I received B.S. degree from the School of Resources and Civil Engineering, Northeastern University in 2019.  
I'm now a member of RSIDEA group, advised by Prof. Yanfei Zhong.

My research interest is weakly supervised remote sensing image process.
